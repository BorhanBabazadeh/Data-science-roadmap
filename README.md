# 🧠 Data Science Roadmap

Welcome to the **Data Science Roadmap** repository.

This project is a structured and continuously evolving collection of implementations of fundamental and advanced **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** algorithms using Python. It is intended as a comprehensive educational resource for anyone interested in understanding the core principles and practical applications of data science.

## 📚 Contents

- ✅ Well-structured and thoroughly documented implementations of classic machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVM)
- ✅ Deep learning models developed using libraries such as NumPy and PyTorch
- ✅ Clear explanations, inline comments, and visualizations to aid conceptual understanding
- ✅ Jupyter notebooks and modular Python scripts for experimentation and reuse

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary goals of this repository are:

- To reinforce and deepen the author's understanding of data science and AI concepts
- To provide high-quality, transparent implementations for educational and reference purposes
- To create a resource that can support both beginners and intermediate learners in their studies

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (3.x)
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 📌 Notes

This repository is a work in progress and will be updated regularly with new algorithms, techniques, and improvements. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are always welcome.
